    <p>Hey everyone! I am 18 and I was born in Utah and now I currently live in Georgia. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Development. One day I hope to start up a video game studio with some of my friends.</p>
    <p>I'm into music composition, 3D modeling and level design for video games. I also enjoy listening to music and hanging out with friends and family.</p>
    <p>I am the second of 7 in my family, and I have four sisters and two brothers. I also have two dogs, one is a Great Pyrenees and the other is a Chihuahua.</p>
